##  Project Overview
This project, **Waste Management Optimization**, was developed as part of **Data Analytics Week 6** at GNCIPL.  
It focuses on analyzing **solid waste management data** to optimize collection, recycling, and disposal processes through a data-driven approach.  

The aim is to identify inefficiencies, propose optimization strategies, and support sustainable urban development using analytical and visualization tools.

---

##  Problem Statement
Rapid urbanization has led to an increase in solid waste generation, resulting in challenges related to collection, recycling, and disposal. Inefficient waste management leads to:  
- Higher operational costs  
- Increased landfill usage  
- Environmental degradation  

This project leverages data analytics to improve operational efficiency and promote sustainability in waste management.

---

##  Objectives
1. Analyze waste generation and recycling patterns (2003–2020).  
2. Evaluate recycling efficiency across various waste types.  
3. Develop insights for optimized waste collection and disposal.  
4. Recommend strategies for sustainable waste management.

---

##  Tools and Technologies
- **SQL Server** – Data cleaning and transformation  
- **Microsoft Excel** – Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and dashboards  
- **Tableau Public** – Interactive visualization and trend analysis  

---

##  Methodology

### 1. Data Acquisition  
Data sourced from Singapore’s public waste management statistics (2003–2020) from kaggle.

### 2. Data Cleaning (SQL)  
- Standardized columns and data types  
- Removed duplicates and handled NULL values  
- Ensured schema consistency

### 3. Exploratory Data Analysis (Excel)  
- Used pivot tables and charts to explore trends  
- Compared recycling vs. disposal rates  
- Created summary dashboards

### 4. Data Visualization (Tableau)  
- Built interactive dashboards for trend analysis  
- Included KPIs, filters, and waste-type visualizations

##  Key Insights
- **Waste Generation Trends:** Increased until 2018, with a slight decline post-2019  
- **Recycling Efficiency:** Paper/Cardboard and Metal had high recycling rates; Plastic and Food Waste lagged behind  
- **Major Contributors:** Paper/Cardboard (26%) and Plastic (17%) made up ~43% of total waste  

---

## Recommendations
- Strengthen recycling systems for **Plastic** and **Food Waste**  
- Introduce **policy incentives** for high-performing industries  
- Conduct **awareness campaigns** on waste segregation and recycling  
- Continuously **monitor dashboards** to update strategies

---

## Expected Outcomes
- Optimized and cost-efficient waste collection schedules  
- Reduced landfill dependency  
- Improved recycling rates through data-backed actions  
- Enhanced decision-making through interactive dashboards  
- Framework for future **smart waste management systems**
